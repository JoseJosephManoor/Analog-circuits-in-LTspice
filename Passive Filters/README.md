### Passive Filters
Designed and simulated first-order filters and a cascaded RC band-pass filter to study cutoff frequency, frequency response, and attenuation characteristics.

- RC and RL low-pass filters  
- RC and RL high-pass filters  
- Cascaded RC band-pass filter (second-order overall response)
