A basic voltage amplifier using a drain resistor as the load. It provides moderate gain with 180° phase inversion.

- Gain: \( Av = -gm.RD \)
- High voltage gain, simple structure
- Limited by resistor headroom and output swing
  
This directory contains the design and LTspice simulation of an NMOS common-source amplifier with a resistive load. This project focuses on the NMOS implementation to keep the scope concise and practical.
